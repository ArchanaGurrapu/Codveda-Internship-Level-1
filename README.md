LEVEL 1 - BASIC
🔹 Task 1: Simple Calculator
I built a Python calculator that performs:
➕ Addition
➖ Subtraction
✖️ Multiplication
➗ Division
I also handled edge cases like division by zero using proper error messages. This task helped me understand functions, user input, and error handling.

🔹 Task 2: Number Guessing Game
I developed a fun game where the system generates a random number (1–100), and the user guesses it.
The program gives feedback like “Too High” or “Too Low” until the correct answer is guessed.
This improved my understanding of loops, conditional statements, and the random module.
